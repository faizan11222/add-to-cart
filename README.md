Hi, you need to run the front-end and back-end server seperately. I've used the mature approach for building this application. Below are the instructions to run the front-end & back-end server.

Note: There is no back-end actually. But I've run JSON API that is acting like back-end (Advance approach)

### please run the command `npm install` for installing node_modules

### please run the command `npm run server` for running back-end server
Runs the app in the development mode.\
json-sever is used for api. server listen on PORT 5000
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)


### please run command `npm start` for running front-end server
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### please run the command `npm run test` for test cases
